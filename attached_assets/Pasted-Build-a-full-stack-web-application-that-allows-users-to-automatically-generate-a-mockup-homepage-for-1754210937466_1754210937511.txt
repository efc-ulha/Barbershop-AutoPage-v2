Build a full-stack web application that allows users to automatically generate a mockup homepage for their barbershop based on a form they fill out.

The goal is to let users preview a site made from one of two available templates, customized with their business details and AI-generated text. Here's what the app should do:

üî∂ FUNCTIONALITY OVERVIEW
Create a form that asks the user for:

Full Name

Email Address

Phone Number

Business Name

Business Type (default: "Barbershop")

Business Location

Services or Products (comma-separated or bullet points)

Short Business Description

Logo Upload (optional, image file)

After submitting the form:

Use an AI text generator (or placeholder function) to produce:

A homepage headline and tagline

A short "About Us" section

Descriptions for services

A call to action (like "Book Now" or "Visit Us Today")

Dynamically fill one of two predefined HTML templates with:

The form information (like business name and location)

The AI-generated text

The uploaded logo (embedded as <img> if provided)

Let the user choose between two template designs before submitting the form.

Templates can be HTML files (e.g., template1.html, template2.html)

Insert dynamic content into them using placeholders

After generation, show the customized homepage mockup as a live HTML preview on the same page.

Can be rendered using an <iframe> or embedded HTML

Below the preview, include two buttons:

‚ÄúDeploy My Website‚Äù

‚ÄúRequest Personalization‚Äù

If the user clicks ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù:

Save the generated HTML file (e.g., in a /mockups/ folder)

Store it with a unique name (based on email or phone number)

üî∂ TECHNICAL NOTES
No database for now ‚Äî store files locally or in memory

The preview must not be downloadable; it's only to view on the site

Make the code modular so that OpenAI API can be added later

Keep the UI clean and responsive using basic styling or a framework like Bootstrap

Optional (not required now):
Stripe/PayPal integration for deployment

Admin dashboard for submitted mockups

Email the HTML mockup link to the user
